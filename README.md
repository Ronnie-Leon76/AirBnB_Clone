## 0x01 Introduction

This is a team project to build a clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The console is a command interpreter to to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).

The console will perform the following tasks:

* create your data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)


### Storage
This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.
